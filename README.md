## DevOps Project: Infrastructure and Application Deployment with Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, and OpenShift

### Project Overview

This project outlines the steps to set up an automated CI/CD pipeline using a combination of Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, Docker, SonarQube, and OpenShift. The goal is to use Terraform to create the necessary infrastructure on AWS, configure Jenkins as the CI/CD server, deploy an application to an OpenShift cluster, and monitor the infrastructure using CloudWatch. Ansible will be used to configure the Jenkins server and install necessary tools and plugins.

### Project Components

1. **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for provisioning AWS resources.
2. **Ansible**: Configuration management tool for setting up Jenkins and other services on the EC2 instance.
3. **Jenkins**: CI/CD tool for automating the build and deployment process.
4. **Docker**: Containerization platform for deploying SonarQube and PostgreSQL.
5. **SonarQube**: Tool for static code analysis.
6. **OpenShift**: Kubernetes-based platform for deploying applications.
7. **CloudWatch**: Monitoring service to track CPU and memory usage.

### Detailed Steps

#### 1. Terraform Configuration

1. **Setting Up VPC and EC2 Instances**:
    - Define the VPC with necessary subnets, route tables, and internet gateways.
    - Provision an EC2 instance within the VPC to serve as the Jenkins server.

2. **Creating CloudWatch Alarms**:
    - Configure CloudWatch alarms for CPU and memory usage on the EC2 instance to monitor performance.

3. **Using Terraform Modules**:
    - Organize the Terraform code into reusable modules for VPC, EC2, and CloudWatch.
    - Example modules: `vpc`, `ec2`, and `cloudwatch`.

4. **Terraform Backend State**:
    - Configure Terraform to use an S3 bucket for state storage and a DynamoDB table for state locking.

#### 2. Ansible Configuration

1. **Installing Docker and Docker Compose**:
    - Use Ansible to install Docker and Docker Compose on the EC2 instance.

2. **Deploying SonarQube and PostgreSQL**:
    - Write a Docker Compose file to deploy SonarQube and PostgreSQL as containers.
    - Use Ansible to execute the Docker Compose file on the EC2 instance.

3. **Setting Up Jenkins**:
    - Use Ansible to install Jenkins, the OpenShift CLI, and necessary Jenkins plugins.
    - Configure Jenkins to use an initial admin password and install initial plugins.

4. **Additional Jenkins Plugins**:
    - Use Ansible to install additional plugins required for the CI/CD pipeline, such as the SonarQube scanner plugin and JDK.

#### 3. Jenkins Configuration

1. **Integrating with OpenShift**:
    - Use a service account token to link Jenkins with the OpenShift cluster.
    - Configure Jenkins to interact with OpenShift using the OpenShift CLI.

2. **Integrating SonarQube with Jenkins**:
    - Configure Jenkins to use SonarQube for code quality analysis using the SonarQube URL and authentication token.
    - Ensure the SonarQube scanner plugin is installed on Jenkins.

3. **Jenkins Pipeline**:
    - Define a Jenkins pipeline with stages for unit testing, static code analysis (SonarQube), Docker image build, and deployment to OpenShift.
    - Use the following stages in the pipeline:
        - **Unit Test**: Run unit tests for the application.
        - **SonarQube Analysis**: Perform static code analysis using SonarQube.
        - **Docker Build and Push**: Build the application Docker image and push it to Docker Hub.
        - **Deployment**: Deploy the application to OpenShift.

#### 4. OpenShift Deployment

1. **Editing Deployment Files**:
    - Update the OpenShift deployment files with the new Docker image name.
    - Use Jenkins to deploy the updated files, including deployment configurations, services, and routes.

2. **Accessing the Application**:
    - Use the route URL provided by OpenShift to access the deployed application.

### Conclusion

This project sets up a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline leveraging Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Ansible for configuration management, Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, Docker for containerization, SonarQube for code quality analysis, and OpenShift for application deployment. The infrastructure is monitored using CloudWatch to ensure optimal performance and availability. By following these steps, you can achieve a fully automated and scalable deployment pipeline.
